    <p> Happy Birthday!</p> <br>
    <p> 
    I am running out of ideas, so here's a special edition of WNRS for you. JK! Those questions are the ones I wanted to ask but wasn't able to because..life. Seriously, time sucks. I wish we could go back to 2008 when time was unlimited, and our schedules revolved around chikas, daydreaming, and just laughing out of nowhere.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    But life happens, and it happens fast. Still, I'm grateful for all our quick messages, IG reels, and TikToks. Seems to be the littlest things, but they really make my day. You always make my day.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    I'm proud of you, big girl ka na! Watching you from afar gives me happiness and excitement. I know you have your own battles, but you're killing it, and you're killing it gracefully.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    I'm lucky to have known the little Gianne, the workaholic G, and now the goal-getter Gabby. Whoever is next, I'm gonna be rooting for her too.
